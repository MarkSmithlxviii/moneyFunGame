# moneyFunGame
A software implementation of the Money Fun Game by Learning Resources.
The Money fun game comes with plastic coins and three types of cards with different problems on them.  This is an attempt to
reproduce the card type where the challange is to select the set number of coins that will add up to the given total.
The script was also how I introduced myself to dictionaries.  I will leave the original (non-functioning) script as a 
starting point for anyone else who is looking to teach themselves dictionaries in Python.
